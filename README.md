# Predicting-Movie-Rental-Durations

A regression model for a DVD rental firm to predict rental duration. Evaluate models to recommend the best one.

## Project Overview
A DVD rental company has approached you to develop a regression model to predict the number of days a customer rents a DVD. The model aims to help the company improve inventory planning efficiency.

This project was inspired by the [DataCamp Machine Learning Scientist Track](https://www.datacamp.com/) and further enhanced with my own analysis and modifications.

## Objectives
- Develop a regression model to predict DVD rental durations.
- Evaluate multiple regression models to identify the best-performing one.
- Provide actionable insights for the company's inventory planning.
